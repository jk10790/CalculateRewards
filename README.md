                               ## React Application to Calculate Rewards for each Transaction ##



A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

## Functionality
   
 The application loads a pre-defined list of transactions from the last 3 months and calculates rewards earned 
 for each transaction.
 
 New Transactions can be added in the textbox populated at the end of the transaction list and rewards will automatically
 be calculated for it and added to the list of transactions.
      ### Simply enter a price in the textbox and hit enter
